	\caption{\bf Hit rates within eight categories} Compare the hit rates of actual data and inferred states of the macaque dataset. A. Multinomial logistic regression sing L1 regularization. Model inferred features outperform the raw data in 5/8 categories and tie in one category. Model wins. B. Multinomial logistic regression sing L2 regularization. Model inferred features outperform 3/8 categories and tie in one. Both tied.
