We appreciate the reviewers' thoughtful comments. We believe that several of the issues raised resulted from poor explanation on our part; we attempt to clarify these below. Moreover, we offer additional comments that we hope highlight the unique contributions of this work to the literature on neural modeling.

1. **Feature recovery**: Reviewers 2 and 5 raised a concern that our model did not recover all the features present in the Roitman and Shadlen dataset (Figure 3). Consequently, our results struck them as somewhat weak, and this diminished their enthusiasm for the work. 

Our presentation of results seems to have failed to convey two key points: 
1. There is very little difference between intermediate coherence levels in the data. This is evident when the average firing rates for each coherence are plotted with uncertainty indicated (i.e., with error bands). Some differences appearing in the lower left panel of Figure 3 do not have much statistical support in the data. That is, our model does recover the features in the data for which there is strong evidence, but parsimoniously prunes those for which there is little evidence. Moreover, because our model achieves this parsimony through a prior, adjusting the prior will result in a higher or lower evidence threshold for feature discovery. We see this as an advantage of our approach, which we will more clearly stress in a revised manuscript.

2. R5 notes "no obvious correspondence between actual and discovered features" in Figure 3. This is a failure of communication on our part. A revised version of the paper will incorporate the suggestions made. But the features do have ready interpretations. For instance:
- Feature Z0 is on when the stimulus is out of the response field (and correctly captures the delay between stim onset and neural response).
- Feature Z2 captures the early vs late stimulus period for most coherences.
- Feature Z4 is specific to an interaction between the highest coherence level (51%) and movement into the response field.
Each of these features not only captures some event determined by the experimenter, but also includes timing information about the neural responses that would not have been known in advance.

2. **Correlated variability**: R2 and R5 note that our model does not include correlated variability among units across stimulus presentations. We agree that this aspect of neural firing is significant and an independence assumption across units is not justified. However, since the datasets we used were the result of single neuron recording, they did not require this additional modeling complexity, and we omitted it from the paper. That said, it a trivial addition to the model to include noise correlations, and we are happy to do so in a revised version of the paper (perhaps in the supplement, in the interest of space).

Related note: R5 notes that the construction on ll98-103 appears unused in the paper. In fact, it is necessary for Experiment 3, in which different clips within the movie database were presented to different neurons in different experimental sessions. Moreover, clip start times were randomly selected from within the larger movie, and thus different units were presented with  different sets of movie frames. We regret the additional complexity of the bookkeeping, but we do need this. We will clarify this point in the revision.

3. **Relation to other models**: R5, R6, and R7 all questioned the relationship between our model and other extant techniques in the literature.
As R5 correctly notes, the key novelty of the model is its applicability to stimulus sets with no intrinsic metric: by asking which stimuli drive neural firing in similar ways, we are constructing a representation of the stimulus space in which neural activity itself supplies the metric. In fact, this answers the question raised by R7, who asks how our method differs from that of simply modeling neural dynamics and correlating the resulting features against the stimulus set: such an approach requires, a priori, a (usually low-dimensional) representation of the stimulus space against which to correlate. In contrast, our model is metric-free.

Reviewer 6, who was enthusiastic about the paper, notes that the interpretation of discovered latent features might be difficult. We agree, but note that topic models, despite also suffering from this problem, have nonetheless proven capable of discovering sensible structure. Indeed, we believe this work to be most applicable to experiments in social neuroscience, where fewer task conditions are under experimental control and there is a desperate need for methods that jointly model neural and stimulus dynamics.

Minor issues:
R5: 1) ll55-56. We did not mean to imply a deficiency. Our main point here was about the need for a metric in existing models, as the reviewer notes. We are happy to clarify in the revision. 2) We are happy to employ a more standard MI normalization.
